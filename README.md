# Task List Project README
### Gehn, Alex

#### Description of Project
My task is build over the Simple Scanning Method Idea. So with my list it gives the user a main menu where they can add a task to there list.  
So at any point the user is able to choose to mark a task as complete and it will grey that task out. The user can also mark a task as started but not complete.  
Which will mark the original task out grey just like complete but then will add it to the bottom of the list again. There are 25 entries per page, and can be  
saved and loaded in. If the first item in the list will be an uncompleted tast at any time.    

#### Task Management  
So i started my project by using the Issue section on github. Also while i was at home i used a little konbon with time limits on it. But i  
honestly wasnt very good at keep in line with my list. My next project i want to have a better plan and try to follow it better.  

#### Time Usage  
-Estimated  
I estimated it would take me around 12-14 hours.   
-Actual  
It took me about 18-20 hours total to complete the list and all its components.  

#### Next Step  
If i were to add more to my list i would want to add a page counter so the user knew which page they were on and also i would add  
a date and time to entry and closing of each task.
